# Data Base Update – 04/01/2021 Mike Hankinson
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Database Integration Deliverables
1.	Database stores static data for use during the project
2.	Database interfaces with the project in some format
3.	Includes at least two tables
4.	Includes at least one join using the database language (not including any joins in Pandas)
5.	Includes at least one connection string (using SQLAlchemy or PyMongo)
6.	Provide ERD with relationships

## Database Integration Progress
As of Thursday, April 1, our Final_Project database answers deliverables 1-4.  I will create the ERD tomorrow (deliverable 6).  
However, at this time, we have not discussed a method to integrate with SQLAlchemy or PyMongo (deliverable 5).  

## File Structure

## File Details

•	**Database_Create_and_Join_Tables_04012021.sql** - This file contains code, that when run within the in pgAdmin Query Editor for the **Final_Project** database accomplishes the following: creates tables **raw_covid_clean** and **country** as well as performs the join on the 2 tables into a third.   Open file with Visual Studio Code.  

•	**Database_ETL_04012021.ipynb** – This file contains python code that performs the following operations:  imports data sets, populates both input tables into the pgAdmin **Final_Project** database.  Open with Jupyter Notebook.  

     **NOTE:  The joined table (model input) is named covid_data_final.  Model inputs must be modified for this change.**  

•	**Database_Integration_04012021.sql** – This file contains the **Final_Project** database that houses 3 tables.  Open file with pgAdmin

•	**Deep_Learning_Recipe.ipynb** - Using python code, develops a model for the data set.  Demonstrates the ability to interact with the **Final_Project** database.

•	**Provisional_ML_Model_Week2.ipynb** – Using python code, develops a model for the data set.  Demonstrates the ability to interact with the **Final_Project** database.

•	**country_index.csv** – Input data containing an index listing of all countries.  This file is read into **Database_Integration_04012021.sql** and populates **country** table.  

•	**owid-covid-data.csv** - Input data containing covid data.  This file is read into **Database_Integration_04012021.sql** and populates **raw_covid_clean** table.  


•	**Action Items**
1.	****Include at least one connection string (using SQLAlchemy or PyMongo).**  Owner: team to discuss
2.	Provide ERD with relationships. Owner: Mike
