# Final_Project
## Overview
This repository contains code for our final project, completed as part of the University of Texas at Austin - Data Analysis and Visualization bootcamp. The project will analyze data related to the Covid-19 pandemic, with the aim of producing a machine learning model that predicts the number of cases/fatalities that a given country can expect in the future.

#### Team Members:
- Mike Hankinson
- Tan Tran
- Luke Newell
- Keith Rabb

### Why did we select this topic?
The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the lives of billions of people all over the globe. Every member of the team has been affected in some way and we would like to use the skills we have learned to contribute to a better understanding of the spread of the virus. 

### Description of the source of data
The dataset we are using is owid-covid-data.csv. The live dataset can be found at https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv and all data produced by Our World in Data are completely open access under the [Creative Commons BY license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). 

### Questions we hope to answer with the data


### Communication protocols
As a team, we will communicate primarily through a private slack channel 'Group_9'. We have also shared our cell phone numbers with each other in case we need to urgently reach another team member. If a team member is unable to join the Tuesday or Thursday meetings, they should notify the other team members via the slack channel. We also have a recurring Zoom meeting set up that team members can join as needed.
