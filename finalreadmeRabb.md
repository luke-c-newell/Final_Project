* Prepped privately on presentation.
* Git Hub commits / pull / create Seg 4
* Add outline back to Google Slides.

## What we would have done differently as a group:
* Added additional features to the machine learning model to include vaccination rates
* Predict the total number of cases instead of the daily cases, as the cumulative number is more consistent, this may be easier for the ML models to interpret than the daily number
 * Compared the FBProphet and the DNN/RNN models graphically
 * Apply a multivariate model with numerous features using the RNN model because of the ability to maintain "memory" throug a feedback loop.
